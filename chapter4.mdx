# Chapter 4: Filtering

## Condition Evaluation

### Basic Conditions

- Multiple conditions separated by `AND` or `OR`
- `AND`: All conditions must be true
- `OR`: At least one condition must be true

Example:

```sql
SELECT emp_id, fname, lname, start_date, title
FROM employee
WHERE title = 'Head Teller'
  AND start_date > '2006-01-01';
```
````

### Using Parentheses

- Grouping conditions for complex logic

Example:

```sql
SELECT emp_id, fname, lname, start_date, title
FROM employee
WHERE (title = 'Head Teller' AND start_date > '2006-01-01')
   OR (title = 'Teller' AND start_date > '2007-01-01');
```

### Using the NOT Operator

- Negates a condition

Example:

```sql
SELECT emp_id, fname, lname, start_date, title
FROM employee
WHERE end_date IS NULL
  AND NOT (title = 'Teller' OR start_date < '2007-01-01');
```

## Condition Types

### Equality Conditions

- Uses `=` operator

Example:

```sql
SELECT pt.name product_type, p.name product
FROM product p INNER JOIN product_type pt
  ON p.product_type_cd = pt.product_type_cd
WHERE pt.name = 'Customer Accounts';
```

### Inequality Conditions

- Uses `!=` or `<>` operators

Example:

```sql
SELECT pt.name product_type, p.name product
FROM product p INNER JOIN product_type pt
  ON p.product_type_cd = pt.product_type_cd
WHERE pt.name <> 'Customer Accounts';
```

### Range Conditions

- Uses `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `BETWEEN` operators

Example:

```sql
SELECT emp_id, fname, lname, start_date
FROM employee
WHERE start_date BETWEEN '2005-01-01' AND '2007-01-01';
```

### Membership Conditions

- Uses `IN` operator

Example:

```sql
SELECT account_id, product_cd, cust_id, avail_balance
FROM account
WHERE product_cd IN ('CHK','SAV','CD','MM');
```

#### Using Subqueries with IN

```sql
SELECT account_id, product_cd, cust_id, avail_balance
FROM account
WHERE product_cd IN (SELECT product_cd
                     FROM product
                     WHERE product_type_cd = 'ACCOUNT');
```

### Matching Conditions

- Uses `LIKE` operator with wildcards
- `_`: Matches exactly one character
- `%`: Matches any number of characters

Example:

```sql
SELECT lname
FROM employee
WHERE lname LIKE '_a%e%';
```

#### Using Regular Expressions

- Uses `REGEXP` operator (MySQL)

Example:

```sql
SELECT emp_id, fname, lname
FROM employee
WHERE lname REGEXP '^[FG]';
```

## Null: Special Considerations

### Testing for Null

- Uses `IS NULL` operator

Example:

```sql
SELECT emp_id, fname, lname, superior_emp_id
FROM employee
WHERE superior_emp_id IS NULL;
```

### Pitfalls with Null

- Null is not equal to anything, including itself

Example (incorrect):

```sql
SELECT emp_id, fname, lname, superior_emp_id
FROM employee
WHERE superior_emp_id = NULL;
```

Example (correct):

```sql
SELECT emp_id, fname, lname, superior_emp_id
FROM employee
WHERE superior_emp_id IS NOT NULL;
```

### Null in Complex Conditions

- Be careful when combining null checks with other conditions

Example:

```sql
SELECT emp_id, fname, lname, superior_emp_id
FROM employee
WHERE superior_emp_id != 6 OR superior_emp_id IS NULL;
```

This chapter delves into the intricacies of filtering data in SQL queries. It covers various types of conditions, the proper use of logical operators, and special considerations when dealing with null values. The examples demonstrate how to construct complex WHERE clauses to precisely filter data based on multiple criteria.

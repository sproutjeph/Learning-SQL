# Chapter 6: Working with Sets

## Key Concepts

- Set theory concepts apply to SQL operations
- SQL provides set operators for combining query results
- Set operators include UNION, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT
- Set operators work on result sets with compatible columns

## Set Theory Primer

Set theory concepts in SQL:

- Union: Combination of two sets
- Intersection: Common elements between two sets
- Except: Elements in one set but not in another

## Set Operators in SQL

### UNION and UNION ALL

UNION combines result sets and removes duplicates. UNION ALL includes all rows, including duplicates.

```sql
SELECT 'IND' type_cd, cust_id, lname name
FROM individual
UNION ALL
SELECT 'BUS' type_cd, cust_id, name
FROM business;
```

This query combines individual and business customer data.

### INTERSECT

INTERSECT returns only rows that appear in both result sets. (Note: Not supported in MySQL)

```sql
SELECT emp_id
FROM employee
INTERSECT
SELECT open_emp_id
FROM account;
```

This would return employee IDs for employees who have opened accounts.

### EXCEPT

EXCEPT returns rows from the first set that don't appear in the second set. (Note: Not supported in MySQL)

```sql
SELECT emp_id
FROM employee
EXCEPT
SELECT DISTINCT open_emp_id
FROM account;
```

This would return employee IDs for employees who haven't opened any accounts.

## Set Operation Rules

### Sorting Combined Results

Use ORDER BY at the end of the compound query:

```sql
SELECT emp_id, assigned_branch_id
FROM employee
WHERE title = 'Teller'
UNION
SELECT open_emp_id, open_branch_id
FROM account
WHERE product_cd = 'SAV'
ORDER BY emp_id;
```

### Set Operation Precedence

Operations are performed from top to bottom unless parentheses are used:

```sql
(SELECT cust_id
 FROM account
 WHERE product_cd IN ('SAV', 'MM')
 UNION ALL
 SELECT a.cust_id
 FROM account a INNER JOIN branch b
 ON a.open_branch_id = b.branch_id
 WHERE b.name = 'Woburn Branch')
INTERSECT
(SELECT cust_id
 FROM account
 WHERE avail_balance BETWEEN 500 AND 2500);
```

## Practical Applications

### Combining Related Data

Use UNION to combine data from related tables:

```sql
SELECT 'CUSTOMER' type, cust_id, lname name
FROM individual
UNION ALL
SELECT 'EMPLOYEE' type, emp_id, lname
FROM employee;
```

### Comparing Sets

Use set operators to compare different data sets:

```sql
SELECT emp_id
FROM employee
WHERE assigned_branch_id = 1
EXCEPT
SELECT DISTINCT open_emp_id
FROM account
WHERE open_branch_id = 1;
```

This finds employees assigned to branch 1 who haven't opened accounts there.

### Data Fabrication

Use set operators to generate test data or date ranges:

```sql
SELECT 'Small' name, 0 low_limit, 4999.99 high_limit
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Medium' name, 5000 low_limit, 9999.99 high_limit
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Large' name, 10000 low_limit, 9999999.99 high_limit;
```

## Key Takeaways

- Set operators work on result sets, not directly on tables
- UNION combines sets, optionally removing duplicates
- INTERSECT finds common elements (not in MySQL)
- EXCEPT finds differences between sets (not in MySQL)
- Result sets must have compatible columns for set operations
- Set operators are useful for combining related data, comparing sets, and data fabrication

Understanding set operations allows for powerful data manipulation and analysis across multiple queries or tables.

Here's a summary of Chapter 9 on Subqueries, formatted as an MDX file:

# Chapter 9: Subqueries

## What Is a Subquery?

A subquery is a query contained within another SQL statement. It can return various result sets:

- A single row with a single column
- Multiple rows with a single column
- Multiple rows and columns

Example of a scalar subquery:

```sql
SELECT account_id, product_cd, cust_id, avail_balance
FROM account
WHERE account_id = (SELECT MAX(account_id) FROM account);
```

## Subquery Types

### Noncorrelated Subqueries

These are independent of the containing statement and can be executed on their own.

```sql
SELECT emp_id, fname, lname, title
FROM employee
WHERE emp_id IN (SELECT superior_emp_id
                 FROM employee);
```

This query finds all employees who are supervisors.

### Correlated Subqueries

These reference columns from the containing statement and are dependent on it.

```sql
SELECT c.cust_id, c.cust_type_cd, c.city
FROM customer c
WHERE 2 = (SELECT COUNT(*)
           FROM account a
           WHERE a.cust_id = c.cust_id);
```

This finds customers with exactly two accounts.

## Subquery Operators

### The IN and NOT IN Operators

Used to check if a value exists within a set returned by a subquery.

```sql
SELECT account_id, product_cd, cust_id
FROM account
WHERE product_cd IN (SELECT product_cd
                     FROM product
                     WHERE product_type_cd = 'LOAN');
```

### The ALL Operator

Compares a value to every value in a set.

```sql
SELECT emp_id, fname, lname, title
FROM employee
WHERE emp_id <> ALL (SELECT superior_emp_id
                     FROM employee
                     WHERE superior_emp_id IS NOT NULL);
```

This finds all employees who are not supervisors.

### The ANY Operator

A condition using ANY is true if any of the comparisons are true.

```sql
SELECT account_id, cust_id, product_cd, avail_balance
FROM account
WHERE avail_balance > ANY (SELECT a.avail_balance
                           FROM account a INNER JOIN individual i
                           ON a.cust_id = i.cust_id
                           WHERE i.fname = 'Frank' AND i.lname = 'Tucker');
```

This finds accounts with a balance greater than any of Frank Tucker's accounts.

## Multicolumn Subqueries

Subqueries can return multiple columns for comparison.

```sql
SELECT account_id, product_cd, cust_id
FROM account
WHERE (open_branch_id, open_emp_id) IN
      (SELECT b.branch_id, e.emp_id
       FROM branch b INNER JOIN employee e
       ON b.branch_id = e.assigned_branch_id
       WHERE b.name = 'Woburn Branch'
       AND (e.title = 'Teller' OR e.title = 'Head Teller'));
```

## The EXISTS Operator

Used to check for the existence of rows returned by a subquery.

```sql
SELECT a.account_id, a.product_cd, a.cust_id, a.avail_balance
FROM account a
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1
              FROM transaction t
              WHERE t.account_id = a.account_id
              AND t.txn_date = '2008-09-22');
```

This finds accounts with transactions on a specific date.

## Subqueries as Data Sources

Subqueries can be used in the FROM clause to create derived tables.

```sql
SELECT e.emp_id, e.fname, e.lname,
       levels.name level_name, levels.type_cd level_type
FROM employee e INNER JOIN
     (SELECT 'Associate' name, 'AS' type_cd, 1 level_nbr
      UNION ALL
      SELECT 'Supervisor' name, 'SV' type_cd, 2 level_nbr
      UNION ALL
      SELECT 'Manager' name, 'MG' type_cd, 3 level_nbr) levels
ON e.job_level = levels.level_nbr;
```

This creates a derived table for employee levels and joins it with the employee table.

## Subqueries in Filter Conditions

Subqueries can be used in WHERE and HAVING clauses for filtering.

```sql
SELECT open_emp_id, COUNT(*) how_many
FROM account
GROUP BY open_emp_id
HAVING COUNT(*) = (SELECT MAX(emp_cnt.how_many)
                   FROM (SELECT COUNT(*) how_many
                         FROM account
                         GROUP BY open_emp_id) emp_cnt);
```

This finds the employee(s) who opened the most accounts.

## Subqueries as Expression Generators

Scalar subqueries can be used wherever an expression is allowed.

```sql
SELECT
  (SELECT p.name FROM product p
   WHERE p.product_cd = a.product_cd) product,
  (SELECT b.name FROM branch b
   WHERE b.branch_id = a.open_branch_id) branch,
  (SELECT CONCAT(e.fname, ' ', e.lname) FROM employee e
   WHERE e.emp_id = a.open_emp_id) name,
  SUM(a.avail_balance) tot_deposits
FROM account a
GROUP BY a.product_cd, a.open_branch_id, a.open_emp_id;
```

This uses correlated subqueries in the SELECT clause to retrieve related data.

## Key Takeaways

- Subqueries provide a powerful way to construct complex queries
- They can be used in various parts of SQL statements (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, HAVING)
- Understanding the different types and uses of subqueries is crucial for advanced SQL programming
- Correlated subqueries can reference the outer query, allowing for more dynamic comparisons
- Subqueries can generate data, create conditions, and serve as derived tables

Remember that while these examples use MySQL syntax, other databases may have slight variations in syntax or available features.

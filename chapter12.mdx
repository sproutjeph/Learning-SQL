Here's a summary of Chapter 12 on Transactions, formatted as an MDX file:

# Chapter 12: Transactions

## Multiuser Databases

Multiuser databases allow multiple users to query and modify data simultaneously, requiring mechanisms to manage concurrent access.

## Locking

Locks control simultaneous use of data resources.

### Locking Strategies

1. Read and Write Locks:

   - Readers request read locks
   - Writers request write locks
   - Only one write lock at a time, read requests blocked until write lock released

2. Versioning:
   - Writers request write locks
   - Readers don't need locks, server ensures consistent view of data

### Lock Granularities

- Table locks: Lock entire tables
- Page locks: Lock memory segments (2 KB to 16 KB)
- Row locks: Lock individual rows

## What Is a Transaction?

A transaction is a mechanism for grouping multiple SQL statements such that either all or none of the statements succeed.

### Transaction Properties (ACID)

- Atomicity: All operations complete successfully or none do
- Consistency: Database remains in a consistent state before and after transaction
- Isolation: Transactions don't interfere with each other
- Durability: Once committed, changes are permanent

### Transaction Example

```sql
START TRANSACTION;

UPDATE account SET avail_balance = avail_balance - 500
WHERE account_id = 9988 AND avail_balance > 500;

IF <exactly one row was updated> THEN
  UPDATE account SET avail_balance = avail_balance + 500
  WHERE account_id = 9989;

  IF <exactly one row was updated> THEN
    COMMIT;
  ELSE
    ROLLBACK;
  END IF;
ELSE
  ROLLBACK;
END IF;
```

This transaction transfers $500 between accounts, rolling back if any step fails.

## Starting a Transaction

Different databases handle transaction creation differently:

- Oracle: Always in a transaction
- MySQL and SQL Server: Must explicitly start transactions

For MySQL and SQL Server:

```sql
START TRANSACTION;
-- or
BEGIN TRANSACTION; -- SQL Server
```

To disable auto-commit mode:

```sql
SET autocommit = 0; -- MySQL
SET IMPLICIT_TRANSACTIONS ON; -- SQL Server
```

## Ending a Transaction

Transactions are ended with COMMIT or ROLLBACK:

```sql
COMMIT;
-- or
ROLLBACK;
```

Transactions can also end due to:

- Server shutdown
- Execution of schema statements (e.g., ALTER TABLE)
- Deadlock detection and resolution

## Transaction Savepoints

Savepoints allow partial rollbacks within a transaction:

```sql
START TRANSACTION;

UPDATE product
SET date_retired = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()
WHERE product_cd = 'XYZ';

SAVEPOINT before_close_accounts;

UPDATE account
SET status = 'CLOSED', close_date = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(),
    last_activity_date = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()
WHERE product_cd = 'XYZ';

ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT before_close_accounts;

COMMIT;
```

This transaction retires a product but rolls back account closures.

## Choosing a Storage Engine (MySQL)

MySQL offers multiple storage engines with different transaction support:

- MyISAM: Non-transactional, table-level locking
- InnoDB: Transactional, row-level locking
- MEMORY: Non-transactional, in-memory tables
- NDB: Transactional, designed for clustering

For transactional support, use InnoDB:

```sql
ALTER TABLE my_table ENGINE = InnoDB;
```

## Key Takeaways

- Transactions ensure data integrity in multi-user environments
- ACID properties guarantee reliable processing of transactions
- Different databases have varying approaches to transaction management
- Savepoints allow for fine-grained control within transactions
- Choice of storage engine in MySQL affects transactional capabilities
- Understanding transactions is crucial for maintaining data consistency and integrity

Remember that while these examples often use MySQL syntax, transactional concepts apply across most relational database systems, although exact implementation details may vary.

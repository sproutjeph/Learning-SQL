# Chapter 10: Joins Revisited

## Outer Joins

Outer joins allow you to retrieve data from multiple tables, including rows that don't have matching values in the joined tables.

### Left Outer Join

Returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table.

```sql
SELECT a.account_id, a.cust_id, b.name
FROM account a LEFT OUTER JOIN business b
  ON a.cust_id = b.cust_id;
```

This query retrieves all accounts, including business names for business accounts.

### Right Outer Join

Returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table.

```sql
SELECT c.cust_id, b.name
FROM customer c RIGHT OUTER JOIN business b
  ON c.cust_id = b.cust_id;
```

This query retrieves all businesses, including those without associated customer records.

## Three-Way Outer Joins

Joining multiple tables with outer joins:

```sql
SELECT a.account_id, a.product_cd,
       CONCAT(i.fname, ' ', i.lname) person_name,
       b.name business_name
FROM account a
LEFT OUTER JOIN individual i ON a.cust_id = i.cust_id
LEFT OUTER JOIN business b ON a.cust_id = b.cust_id;
```

This query retrieves all accounts with associated individual or business names.

## Self Outer Joins

Joining a table to itself using an outer join:

```sql
SELECT e.fname, e.lname,
       e_mgr.fname mgr_fname, e_mgr.lname mgr_lname
FROM employee e LEFT OUTER JOIN employee e_mgr
  ON e.superior_emp_id = e_mgr.emp_id;
```

This query retrieves all employees and their managers, including employees without managers.

## Cross Joins

A cross join produces the Cartesian product of two tables.

```sql
SELECT pt.name, p.product_cd, p.name
FROM product p CROSS JOIN product_type pt;
```

This creates all possible combinations of products and product types.

### Practical Use of Cross Joins

Generating a series of dates:

```sql
SELECT DATE_ADD('2008-01-01',
       INTERVAL (ones.num + tens.num + hundreds.num) DAY) dt
FROM
  (SELECT 0 num UNION ALL SELECT 1 UNION ALL SELECT 2 UNION ALL SELECT 3
   UNION ALL SELECT 4 UNION ALL SELECT 5 UNION ALL SELECT 6 UNION ALL
   SELECT 7 UNION ALL SELECT 8 UNION ALL SELECT 9) ones
CROSS JOIN
  (SELECT 0 num UNION ALL SELECT 10 UNION ALL SELECT 20 UNION ALL SELECT 30
   UNION ALL SELECT 40 UNION ALL SELECT 50 UNION ALL SELECT 60 UNION ALL
   SELECT 70 UNION ALL SELECT 80 UNION ALL SELECT 90) tens
CROSS JOIN
  (SELECT 0 num UNION ALL SELECT 100 UNION ALL SELECT 200 UNION ALL SELECT 300) hundreds
WHERE DATE_ADD('2008-01-01',
      INTERVAL (ones.num + tens.num + hundreds.num) DAY) < '2009-01-01'
ORDER BY 1;
```

This generates all dates in the year 2008.

## Natural Joins

Natural joins automatically join tables based on columns with the same name.

```sql
SELECT a.account_id, a.cust_id, c.cust_type_cd, c.fed_id
FROM account a NATURAL JOIN customer c;
```

This joins the account and customer tables on the cust_id column.

### Caution with Natural Joins

Natural joins can lead to unexpected results if tables have multiple columns with the same name that aren't meant to be join conditions.

## Key Takeaways

- Outer joins allow inclusion of unmatched rows from one or both tables
- Left and right outer joins determine which table's unmatched rows are included
- Self outer joins are useful for hierarchical data like employee-manager relationships
- Cross joins create all possible combinations between two tables
- Natural joins can be convenient but risky; explicit join conditions are generally safer
- Understanding different join types is crucial for complex data retrieval and analysis

Remember to always consider the specific requirements of your query when choosing a join type, and be aware of the potential impact on performance, especially with large datasets.

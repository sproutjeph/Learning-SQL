# Chapter 14: Views

## What Are Views?

Views are named SQL queries stored in the database. They act as virtual tables, providing a way to simplify complex queries and control data access.

### Creating a View

Basic syntax for creating a view:

```sql
CREATE VIEW customer_vw
 (cust_id, fed_id, cust_type_cd, address, city, state, zipcode)
AS
SELECT cust_id,
 concat('ends in ', substr(fed_id, 8, 4)) fed_id,
 cust_type_cd, address, city, state, postal_code
FROM customer;
```

This view partially obscures the federal ID for privacy.

### Querying a View

Views are queried like tables:

```sql
SELECT cust_id, fed_id, cust_type_cd
FROM customer_vw;
```

## Why Use Views?

### Data Security

Views can restrict access to sensitive data:

```sql
CREATE VIEW business_customer_vw
AS
SELECT cust_id, fed_id, cust_type_cd, address, city, state, postal_code
FROM customer
WHERE cust_type_cd = 'B';
```

This view only shows business customers.

### Data Aggregation

Views can pre-aggregate data for reporting:

```sql
CREATE VIEW customer_totals_vw
AS
SELECT cst.cust_id, cst.cust_type_cd,
 CASE
  WHEN cst.cust_type_cd = 'B' THEN
   (SELECT bus.name FROM business bus WHERE bus.cust_id = cst.cust_id)
  ELSE
   (SELECT concat(ind.fname, ' ', ind.lname)
    FROM individual ind WHERE ind.cust_id = cst.cust_id)
 END cust_name,
 sum(CASE WHEN act.status = 'ACTIVE' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) tot_active_accounts,
 sum(CASE WHEN act.status = 'ACTIVE' THEN act.avail_balance ELSE 0 END) tot_balance
FROM customer cst INNER JOIN account act ON act.cust_id = cst.cust_id
GROUP BY cst.cust_id, cst.cust_type_cd;
```

### Hiding Complexity

Views can simplify complex queries:

```sql
CREATE VIEW branch_activity_vw
AS
SELECT br.name, br.city, br.state,
 (SELECT count(*) FROM employee emp WHERE emp.assigned_branch_id = br.branch_id) num_emps,
 (SELECT count(*) FROM account acnt
  WHERE acnt.status = 'ACTIVE' AND acnt.open_branch_id = br.branch_id) num_accounts,
 (SELECT count(*) FROM transaction txn
  WHERE txn.execution_branch_id = br.branch_id) num_txns
FROM branch br;
```

### Joining Partitioned Data

Views can combine data from multiple tables:

```sql
CREATE VIEW transaction_vw
AS
SELECT txn_date, account_id, txn_type_cd, amount, teller_emp_id,
 execution_branch_id, funds_avail_date
FROM transaction_historic
UNION ALL
SELECT txn_date, account_id, txn_type_cd, amount, teller_emp_id,
 execution_branch_id, funds_avail_date
FROM transaction_current;
```

## Updatable Views

Under certain conditions, views can be used to modify underlying data.

### Conditions for Updatable Views

- No aggregate functions
- No GROUP BY or HAVING clauses
- No UNION, UNION ALL, or DISTINCT
- FROM clause includes at least one table
- Only inner joins (if multiple tables)

### Updating Simple Views

Example of updating through a view:

```sql
UPDATE customer_vw
SET city = 'Woburn'
WHERE city = 'Woooburn';
```

### Updating Complex Views

Updating views with multiple tables:

```sql
UPDATE business_customer_vw
SET postal_code = '99999'
WHERE cust_id = 10;
```

## Key Takeaways

- Views provide a layer of abstraction over tables
- Views can enhance security by restricting data access
- Views simplify complex queries and data aggregation
- Views can unify partitioned data
- Some views are updatable, allowing data modification through the view
- Views are powerful tools for managing data access and simplifying database interactions

Remember that while these examples use MySQL syntax, the concept of views is common across most relational database systems, though specific features and syntax may vary.

# Chapter 3: Query Primer

## Query Mechanics

- Database connections: Assigned unique identifiers
- Query execution process:
  1. Permission check
  2. Syntax validation
  3. Optimization
  4. Execution

## Query Clauses

### SELECT Clause

- Determines columns in the result set
- Can include:
  - Column names
  - Literals
  - Expressions
  - Function calls

Example:

```sql
SELECT emp_id, 'ACTIVE' status, emp_id * 3.14159 AS emp_id_pi, UPPER(lname) AS last_name_upper
FROM employee;
```
````

#### Column Aliases

- Use `AS` keyword or space between column and alias

```sql
SELECT emp_id, 'ACTIVE' AS status, emp_id * 3.14159 empid_x_pi
FROM employee;
```

#### Removing Duplicates

- Use `DISTINCT` keyword

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT cust_id
FROM account;
```

### FROM Clause

- Defines tables and table joins
- Can include subqueries and views

#### Subquery-generated tables

```sql
SELECT e.emp_id, e.fname, e.lname
FROM (SELECT emp_id, fname, lname, start_date, title
      FROM employee) e;
```

#### Views

```sql
CREATE VIEW employee_vw AS
SELECT emp_id, fname, lname,
       YEAR(start_date) start_year
FROM employee;

SELECT emp_id, start_year
FROM employee_vw;
```

#### Table Links (Joins)

```sql
SELECT e.emp_id, e.fname, e.lname, d.name dept_name
FROM employee e INNER JOIN department d
  ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;
```

#### Table Aliases

```sql
SELECT e.emp_id, e.fname, e.lname, d.name dept_name
FROM employee AS e INNER JOIN department AS d
  ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;
```

### WHERE Clause

- Filters rows based on specified conditions
- Uses logical operators: AND, OR, NOT

Example:

```sql
SELECT emp_id, fname, lname, start_date, title
FROM employee
WHERE title = 'Teller'
  AND start_date < '2007-01-01';
```

### GROUP BY and HAVING Clauses

- GROUP BY: Groups rows based on column values
- HAVING: Filters grouped data

Example:

```sql
SELECT d.name, COUNT(e.emp_id) num_employees
FROM department d INNER JOIN employee e
  ON d.dept_id = e.dept_id
GROUP BY d.name
HAVING COUNT(e.emp_id) > 2;
```

### ORDER BY Clause

- Sorts the result set
- Can sort by multiple columns, expressions, or column positions

Examples:

```sql
SELECT open_emp_id, product_cd
FROM account
ORDER BY open_emp_id;

SELECT open_emp_id, product_cd
FROM account
ORDER BY open_emp_id, product_cd;

SELECT emp_id, title, start_date, fname, lname
FROM employee
ORDER BY 2, 5;
```

## Filtering Techniques

### Equality Conditions

```sql
SELECT pt.name product_type, p.name product
FROM product p INNER JOIN product_type pt
  ON p.product_type_cd = pt.product_type_cd
WHERE pt.name = 'Customer Accounts';
```

### Inequality Conditions

```sql
SELECT pt.name product_type, p.name product
FROM product p INNER JOIN product_type pt
  ON p.product_type_cd = pt.product_type_cd
WHERE pt.name <> 'Customer Accounts';
```

### Range Conditions

```sql
SELECT emp_id, fname, lname, start_date
FROM employee
WHERE start_date BETWEEN '2005-01-01' AND '2007-01-01';
```

### Membership Conditions

```sql
SELECT account_id, product_cd, cust_id, avail_balance
FROM account
WHERE product_cd IN ('CHK','SAV','CD','MM');
```

### Matching Conditions

```sql
SELECT lname
FROM employee
WHERE lname LIKE '_a%e%';
```

## Complex Queries

### Subqueries in FROM clause

```sql
SELECT a.account_id, a.cust_id, a.open_date, a.product_cd
FROM account a INNER JOIN
  (SELECT emp_id, assigned_branch_id
   FROM employee
   WHERE start_date < '2007-01-01'
     AND (title = 'Teller' OR title = 'Head Teller')) e
  ON a.open_emp_id = e.emp_id
INNER JOIN
  (SELECT branch_id
   FROM branch
   WHERE name = 'Woburn Branch') b
  ON e.assigned_branch_id = b.branch_id;
```

### Self-Joins

```sql
SELECT e.fname, e.lname,
       e_mgr.fname mgr_fname, e_mgr.lname mgr_lname
FROM employee e INNER JOIN employee e_mgr
  ON e.superior_emp_id = e_mgr.emp_id;
```

This chapter covers the fundamentals of SQL queries, including the various clauses of the SELECT statement, filtering techniques, and more complex query structures. It provides a foundation for understanding how to retrieve and manipulate data from relational databases using SQL.

# Chapter 5: Querying Multiple Tables

## Key Concepts

- Joins allow combining data from multiple related tables
- Inner joins return only matching rows from both tables
- The ON clause specifies the join condition
- Table aliases provide shorthand references to tables
- Multiple tables can be joined in a single query

## Inner Joins

Inner joins return only rows that have matching values in both tables being joined. The basic syntax is:

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column
```

For example:

```sql
SELECT employee.emp_id, employee.fname, employee.lname, department.name
FROM employee
INNER JOIN department
ON employee.dept_id = department.dept_id;
```

This joins the `employee` and `department` tables on the `dept_id` column.

## Table Aliases

Table aliases provide shorthand references to table names:

```sql
SELECT e.emp_id, e.fname, e.lname, d.name
FROM employee e
INNER JOIN department d
ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;
```

## Joining Multiple Tables

Multiple tables can be joined by adding additional INNER JOIN clauses:

```sql
SELECT a.account_id, c.fed_id, e.fname, e.lname
FROM account a
INNER JOIN customer c ON a.cust_id = c.cust_id
INNER JOIN employee e ON a.open_emp_id = e.emp_id
WHERE c.cust_type_cd = 'B';
```

This joins the `account`, `customer`, and `employee` tables.

## Using Subqueries as Tables

Subqueries can be used in the FROM clause as derived tables:

```sql
SELECT a.account_id, a.cust_id, a.open_date, a.product_cd
FROM account a INNER JOIN
  (SELECT emp_id, assigned_branch_id
   FROM employee
   WHERE start_date < '2007-01-01'
   AND (title = 'Teller' OR title = 'Head Teller')) e
ON a.open_emp_id = e.emp_id
INNER JOIN
  (SELECT branch_id
   FROM branch
   WHERE name = 'Woburn Branch') b
ON e.assigned_branch_id = b.branch_id;
```

This uses subqueries to join only certain employees and branches.

## Self Joins

A table can be joined to itself, typically using different aliases:

```sql
SELECT e.fname, e.lname,
  e_mgr.fname mgr_fname, e_mgr.lname mgr_lname
FROM employee e
INNER JOIN employee e_mgr
ON e.superior_emp_id = e_mgr.emp_id;
```

This self-joins the employee table to get each employee's manager.

## Key Takeaways

- Inner joins are the most common type of join
- The ON clause defines how tables are related
- Table aliases improve query readability
- Multiple tables can be joined in a single query
- Subqueries can be used as derived tables in joins
- Self-joins allow relating a table to itself

Understanding how to properly join tables is crucial for working with relational databases and writing efficient queries across multiple tables.

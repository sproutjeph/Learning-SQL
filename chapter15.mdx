Here's a summary of Chapter 15 and a brief overview of the rest of the book, formatted as an MDX file:

# Chapter 15: Metadata

## What is Metadata?

Metadata is data about data. In databases, it includes information about database objects such as tables, columns, indexes, and constraints.

## Accessing Metadata

Different databases provide various ways to access metadata:

- Oracle: User views (e.g., USER_TABLES, ALL_CONSTRAINTS)
- SQL Server: System stored procedures and INFORMATION_SCHEMA views
- MySQL: INFORMATION_SCHEMA database

### Example Queries Using INFORMATION_SCHEMA

Listing all tables in a database:

```sql
SELECT table_name, table_type
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'bank'
ORDER BY 1;
```

Viewing column information:

```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type, character_maximum_length char_max_len,
       numeric_precision num_prcsn, numeric_scale num_scale
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema = 'bank' AND table_name = 'account'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;
```

## Working with Metadata

### Schema Generation Scripts

Generating CREATE TABLE statements:

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(
  'CREATE TABLE ', table_name, ' (\n',
  GROUP_CONCAT(
    CONCAT('  ', column_name, ' ', column_type,
           CASE WHEN is_nullable = 'NO' THEN ' NOT NULL' ELSE '' END)
    ORDER BY ordinal_position
    SEPARATOR ',\n'
  ),
  '\n);'
)
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema = 'bank' AND table_name = 'customer'
GROUP BY table_name;
```

### Deployment Verification

Checking table structure after deployment:

```sql
SELECT tbl.table_name,
       COUNT(*) num_columns,
       SUM(CASE WHEN col.column_key = 'PRI' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) num_primary_keys
FROM information_schema.tables tbl
JOIN information_schema.columns col
  ON tbl.table_schema = col.table_schema AND tbl.table_name = col.table_name
WHERE tbl.table_schema = 'bank' AND tbl.table_type = 'BASE TABLE'
GROUP BY tbl.table_name;
```

### Dynamic SQL Generation

Using metadata to generate dynamic queries:

```sql
SET @table_name = 'account';
SET @query = CONCAT(
  'SELECT ',
  (SELECT GROUP_CONCAT(COLUMN_NAME)
   FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
   WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'bank' AND TABLE_NAME = @table_name),
  ' FROM ', @table_name
);

PREPARE stmt FROM @query;
EXECUTE stmt;
DEALLOCATE PREPARE stmt;
```

## Key Takeaways

- Metadata provides essential information about database structure
- INFORMATION_SCHEMA views offer a standardized way to access metadata
- Metadata can be used for schema generation, verification, and dynamic SQL
- Understanding metadata is crucial for database administration and development

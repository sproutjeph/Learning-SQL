Here's a summary of Chapter 11 on Conditional Logic, formatted as an MDX file:

# Chapter 11: Conditional Logic

## What Is Conditional Logic?

Conditional logic in SQL allows for different actions or results based on specified conditions. It's primarily implemented using CASE expressions.

## The Case Expression

CASE expressions provide if-then-else logic within SQL statements.

### Searched Case Expressions

```sql
SELECT account_id, product_cd, cust_id,
  CASE
    WHEN avail_balance < 0 THEN 'OVERDRAWN'
    WHEN avail_balance = 0 THEN 'ZERO BALANCE'
    WHEN avail_balance < 1000 THEN 'LOW BALANCE'
    ELSE 'SUFFICIENT FUNDS'
  END status
FROM account;
```

This categorizes accounts based on their available balance.

### Simple Case Expressions

```sql
SELECT cust_id, cust_type_cd,
  CASE cust_type_cd
    WHEN 'I' THEN 'Individual Customer'
    WHEN 'B' THEN 'Business Customer'
    ELSE 'Unknown Customer Type'
  END customer_type
FROM customer;
```

This translates customer type codes to descriptive text.

## Case Expression Examples

### Result Set Transformations

Pivoting data from rows to columns:

```sql
SELECT
  SUM(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM open_date) = 2000 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) year_2000,
  SUM(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM open_date) = 2001 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) year_2001,
  SUM(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM open_date) = 2002 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) year_2002
FROM account
WHERE open_date > '1999-12-31' AND open_date < '2003-01-01';
```

This query counts accounts opened in each year from 2000 to 2002.

### Selective Aggregation

Using CASE within aggregate functions:

```sql
SELECT
  SUM(CASE
    WHEN product_cd = 'CHK' THEN avail_balance
    ELSE 0
  END) chk_balance,
  SUM(CASE
    WHEN product_cd = 'SAV' THEN avail_balance
    ELSE 0
  END) sav_balance
FROM account;
```

This calculates total balances for checking and savings accounts separately.

### Checking for Existence

Using CASE with EXISTS:

```sql
SELECT c.cust_id, c.fed_id,
  CASE
    WHEN EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM account a
                 WHERE a.cust_id = c.cust_id
                 AND a.product_cd = 'CHK') THEN 'Y'
    ELSE 'N'
  END has_checking,
  CASE
    WHEN EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM account a
                 WHERE a.cust_id = c.cust_id
                 AND a.product_cd = 'SAV') THEN 'Y'
    ELSE 'N'
  END has_savings
FROM customer c;
```

This checks if each customer has checking and savings accounts.

### Division-by-Zero Errors

Preventing division by zero:

```sql
SELECT
  (avail_balance / CASE WHEN avail_balance = 0 THEN 1 ELSE avail_balance END) * 100
  AS pct_balance
FROM account;
```

This calculates a percentage without risking a division by zero error.

### Conditional Updates

Using CASE in UPDATE statements:

```sql
UPDATE account
SET last_activity_date = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(),
    avail_balance = avail_balance +
      (SELECT CASE
         WHEN t.funds_avail_date > CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() THEN 0
         ELSE t.amount * CASE t.txn_type_cd WHEN 'DBT' THEN -1 ELSE 1 END
       END
       FROM transaction t
       WHERE t.txn_id = 999)
WHERE account.account_id = (SELECT account_id
                            FROM transaction
                            WHERE txn_id = 999);
```

This updates an account balance based on a transaction, considering transaction type and funds availability.

### Handling Null Values

Using CASE to handle NULL values:

```sql
SELECT emp_id, fname, lname,
  CASE
    WHEN title IS NULL THEN 'Unknown'
    ELSE title
  END as emp_title
FROM employee;
```

This replaces NULL titles with 'Unknown'.

## Key Takeaways

- CASE expressions provide powerful conditional logic within SQL
- Searched CASE expressions offer more flexibility than simple CASE expressions
- CASE can be used in SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, and UPDATE clauses
- CASE is useful for data transformations, selective aggregation, and handling special cases like NULL values or division by zero
- Complex business logic can often be implemented directly in SQL using CASE expressions
- Understanding CASE expressions is crucial for writing flexible and powerful SQL queries

Remember that while these examples use MySQL syntax, the CASE expression is part of the SQL standard and is available in most major database systems with similar syntax.

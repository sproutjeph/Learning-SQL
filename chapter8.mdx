# Chapter 8: Grouping and Aggregates

## Grouping Concepts

Grouping allows analysis of data at a higher level of granularity by combining rows based on common column values.

### Basic Grouping

```sql
SELECT open_emp_id, COUNT(*) how_many
FROM account
GROUP BY open_emp_id;
```

This query counts the number of accounts opened by each employee.

## Aggregate Functions

Aggregate functions perform calculations across a set of rows.

### Common Aggregate Functions

- COUNT(): Counts the number of rows
- SUM(): Calculates the sum of a set of values
- AVG(): Calculates the average of a set of values
- MAX(): Finds the maximum value in a set
- MIN(): Finds the minimum value in a set

Example using multiple aggregate functions:

```sql
SELECT MAX(avail_balance) max_balance,
       MIN(avail_balance) min_balance,
       AVG(avail_balance) avg_balance,
       SUM(avail_balance) tot_balance,
       COUNT(*) num_accounts
FROM account
WHERE product_cd = 'CHK';
```

## Implicit vs. Explicit Groups

### Implicit Groups

When using aggregate functions without GROUP BY, the entire result set is treated as a single group.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) num_accounts
FROM account;
```

### Explicit Groups

Use GROUP BY to specify grouping columns:

```sql
SELECT product_cd, COUNT(*) num_accounts
FROM account
GROUP BY product_cd;
```

## Counting Distinct Values

Use DISTINCT within COUNT() to count unique values:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT open_emp_id)
FROM account;
```

## Using Expressions in Group BY and Aggregate Functions

```sql
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_date) year,
       COUNT(*) how_many
FROM employee
GROUP BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_date);
```

This groups employees by the year they started.

## Generating Rollups

Use WITH ROLLUP to include subtotals:

```sql
SELECT product_cd, open_branch_id,
       SUM(avail_balance) tot_balance
FROM account
GROUP BY product_cd, open_branch_id WITH ROLLUP;
```

## Group Filter Conditions

### HAVING Clause

Use HAVING to filter groups based on aggregate results:

```sql
SELECT product_cd, SUM(avail_balance) prod_balance
FROM account
WHERE status = 'ACTIVE'
GROUP BY product_cd
HAVING SUM(avail_balance) >= 10000;
```

This query finds product types with a total balance of at least $10,000.

## Differences Between WHERE and HAVING

- WHERE filters individual rows before grouping
- HAVING filters groups after grouping is performed

```sql
SELECT product_cd, SUM(avail_balance) prod_balance
FROM account
WHERE status = 'ACTIVE'
GROUP BY product_cd
HAVING MIN(avail_balance) >= 1000
   AND MAX(avail_balance) <= 10000;
```

This query filters active accounts, groups by product, then filters groups based on minimum and maximum balances.

## Advanced Grouping Techniques

### Grouping via Expressions

```sql
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_date) year,
       COUNT(*) how_many
FROM employee
GROUP BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_date);
```

### Grouping with Rollups

```sql
SELECT product_cd, open_branch_id,
       SUM(avail_balance) tot_balance
FROM account
GROUP BY product_cd, open_branch_id WITH ROLLUP;
```

This generates subtotals for each product across all branches.

## Key Takeaways

- GROUP BY allows data analysis at various levels of granularity
- Aggregate functions perform calculations across groups of rows
- HAVING filters groups, while WHERE filters individual rows
- Expressions can be used in GROUP BY and aggregate functions
- ROLLUP generates subtotals and grand totals
- Understanding grouping and aggregates is crucial for data analysis and reporting in SQL

Remember that while these examples use MySQL syntax, other databases may have slight variations in syntax or available features.
